    <p> 
    My experience with computers thus far is that I have taken CS1, CS2, CS3, Assembly language, discrete algorithm, 
    and digital logic.  I am proficient is java, and familiar with c, and c++. I have been the point person on troubleshooting 
    on tech issues at work (Shoprite) , basic computer issues on PC, POS, and tablets (very limited access). 
	What I see myself using the skills I'll learn in this class is building my own website for my YouTube channel;
      The Garden Nerd (  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkiwRLE7TxK4dRYoLYjfq7w) to help build my brand,  more of  hobby,
       fun, and to help build my portfolio /resume. I also see the possibility of getting some side jobs building websites for 
       people and businesses.
